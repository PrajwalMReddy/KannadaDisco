# Dative Case

### The dative case in Kannada shows the recipient of an action. It can also be used to indicate movement towards something, in terms of direction. To form the dative case, -ಕ್ಕೆ (kke) is added to words that end with ಅ. Otherwise, -ಗೆ (ge) is added. For example, ಪುಸ್ತಕಕ್ಕೆ (pustakakke) or ‘to the book’ and ಶಾಲೆಗೆ (śālege) or ‘to the school’.
