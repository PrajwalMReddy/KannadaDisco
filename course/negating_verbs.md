# Negating Verbs

### The negative forms of the verbs indicate not doing the specified action. The good thing about this form is that there is no marking based on person and number; that is, there is only one ending that needs to be learned for each tense. As an example, ‘ಕೊಡಲ್ಲ’ (koḍalla) means ‘won’t give’. The subject is understood through context.

### The following table gives the suffixes for each tense:

|      English       |  Kannada   | Transliteration |
|:------------------:|:----------:|:---------------:|
|   Present/Future   |   -ಅಲ್ಲ    |      -alla      |
|  Present Perfect   |   -ಇಲ್ಲ    |      -illa      |
| Present Continuous |  -ತ ಇಲ್ಲ   |    -ta illa     |
|    Past Simple     |   -ಲಿಲ್ಲ   |     -lilla      |
|  Past Continuous   | -ತ ಇರಲಿಲ್ಲ |  -ta iralilla   |
