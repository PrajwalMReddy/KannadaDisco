# Modality Suffixes

### Verbs can take a variety of suffixes that express modal meanings, which are similar to ‘could’, ‘should’, ‘must’, etc. in English. This is added to the end of the verb in the same way as the other tense suffixes. It is important to note, however, that modality suffixes do not depend on person. Therefore, ಮಾಡ್ಬೇಕು (māḍbēku) could mean ‘I have to go’, ‘you have to do’, etc.
