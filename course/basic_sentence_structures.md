# Basic Sentence Structures

### The simplest sentences in Kannada consist of two nouns or noun phrases side by side. Unlike in English, a connecting verb, or copula, is not required. The following are all examples of this where the helping verb *to be* is implied through the juxtaposition of the nouns phrases.
