# Verb Suffixes

### Other than the modality suffixes, there are various other suffixes that verbs could take to express more precise and exact meanings. Again, this is independent of person.

### The following table gives several suffixes that verbs can take:

|                English                 | Kannada | Transliteration |
|:--------------------------------------:|:-------:|:---------------:|
|                Let us -                |   -ಓಣ   |      -ōṇa       |
|                  To -                  | -ಅಕ್ಕೆ  |      -akke      |
|                  -ing                  |  -ವುದು  |      -vudu      |

|                  If -                  |  -ಇದರೆ  |     -idare      |
|               Even if -                |  -ಇದರೂ  |     -idarū      |
|         Just do it (quickly) -         |  -ಬಿಡು  |      -biḍu      |
| Just do it (quickly) (plural/polite) - |  -ಬಿಡಿ  |      -biḍi      |
|           Reflexive marker -           |   -ಕೋ   |       -kō       |
|   Reflexive marker (plural/polite) -   | -ಕೊಳ್ಳಿ |     -koḷḷi      |

### The last 4 columns are slightly complicated verb forms that convey subtle nuances in meaning. The translation has been given as best as we could, but the only way to understand the suffixes for sure is to listen to other speakers to gain an intuitive understanding of those suffixes.

### An interesting ‘suffix’ that can be added to verbs is the verb ಹೋಗು (hōgu) which means ‘go’. When this is combined with other verbs in the same way as other suffixes, it conveys the meaning of ‘go do (verb)’. For example, ತಿನ್ಹೋಗು ‘tinhōgu’ means ‘go eat’.
