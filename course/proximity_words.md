# Proximity Words

### There are words that differ only in their first character. These can start with ಅ (a) and ಇ (i) and the difference between the words is the proximity of the thing being referred to. In the Pronouns module, all the 3rd person pronouns are seen to start with ಅ. However, they also have another form that starts with ಇ.

### The difference between these two forms is that the form with ಅ refers to something far away while the form with ಇ refers to something close by. For example, ಅವರು (avaru) could mean ‘those people’ while ಇವರು (ivaru) could mean ‘these people’. If the proximity is unknown or unimportant, the ಅ form is the default.

### A list of the most common pairs is given below:

|      That / This      |     ಆ / ಈ     |    а̄ / ī     | 
|          He           |  ಅವನು / ಇವನು  | avanu / ivanu | 
|          She          |  ಅವಳು / ಇವಳು  | avaḷu / ivaḷu | 
|   That Is / This is   |   ಅದು / ಇದು   |   adu / idu   | 
|         They          |  ಅವರು / ಇವರು  | avaru / ivaru | 
| Those Are / These are |   ಅವು / ಇವು   |   avu / ivu   |

### Moreover, a few words may feature an ಎ (e) sound as well, along with the ಅ and ಇ sounds. The ಅ and ಇ have the same role of indicating proximity. However, the ಎ turns the word into a question word, as can be seen in the Question Words module. Some common examples are given below.
