# Verbs and the Imperative Mood

### Verbs are an extremely important aspect of any language, and Kannada is no exception. In Kannada, the most basic form of the verb, or the dictionary form, is the imperative mood. The imperative mood expresses a command or an order. In Kannada, verbs can end with an ಉ (u), ಎ (e), or ಇ (i) sound. For example, ಮಾಡು (mа̄du) means ‘do’.

### Just like for pronouns, the ending of the verb changes when referring to more than one person or when you want to be more respectful. Here, the ending of the verb changes to ಇ such as ಮಾಡಿ (mа̄di) which could mean ‘please do’. If the verb already ended with a ಎ or ಇ sound, add ರಿ (ri) to the end of the verb. For example, ಕುಡಿ (kuḍi) means drink while ಕುಡಿರಿ (kuḍiri) could mean ‘please drink’.

## Here is a list of basic, everyday verbs that you should know:
