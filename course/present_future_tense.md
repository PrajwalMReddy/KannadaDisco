# Present/Future Tense

### Tenses represent when in time an action occurs. The simplest tense in Kannada is the Present/Future tense. This tense represents simple present and future actions. Additionally, this tense can express the habitual aspect where the subject does an action usually or customarily. For example, ಮಾಡ್ತೀನಿ (māḍtīni) could mean ‘I do’ or ‘I will do’.

### To form this tense, the relevant endings are added onto the stem of the relevant word. For words that end in ಉ (u), the stem is formed by removing the ಉ. For verbs ending in ಇ (i) or ಎ (e), the endings are added directly onto the verb without any changes.

### The endings are as follows:
