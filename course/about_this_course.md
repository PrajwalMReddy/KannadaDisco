### Kannada is a Dravidian language primarily spoken by more than 45 million native speakers in the Indian state of Karnataka and the surrounding regions. It has its own script, the Kannada script, and its literary tradition stretches back over a millennia. Kannada is also recognized as a classical language of India and its literature has earned 8 Jnanpith Awards, the second highest number for any language.
### These lessons are designed for those who do not know Kannada but wish to learn it. They assume no prior knowledge of the language. It is important to note, though, that this guide is not comprehensive in that it cannot teach every single feature of Kannada. Moreover, it only teaches spoken Kannada, the way a native speaker may speak, rather than the written langauge. However, it is still important to practice speaking on your own; while this app will teach you to recognize the vocabulary and grammar features used, practice with others will ensure that you become fluent.
