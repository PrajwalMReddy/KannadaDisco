# Genitive Case

### Kannada has a concept called cases, which are basically inflections in a word that show its role in a sentence. In Kannada, these cases are added on to the end of the word and can basically be treated as a suffix.

### The genitive case in Kannada indicates a relationship between nouns, usually possession. The important thing to learn is the genitive forms of the pronouns, as they express possession. For example, ನನ್ನ ಪುಸ್ತಕ (nanna pustaka) means ‘my book’ and ನಮ್ಮ ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು (namma beṅgaḷūru) means ‘our Bangalore’.
