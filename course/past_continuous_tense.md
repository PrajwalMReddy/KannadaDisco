# Past Continuous Tense

### Like the present continuous tense, the past continuous tense is used to describe activities that were taking place in the past. To form this tense, add the given endings to the end of the word, with verbs ending in ಉ (u) dropping the ಉ and verbs ending in ಇ (i) or ಎ (e) keeping the final vowel sound. For example, ಹೋಗ್ತಾ ಇದ್ರು (hо̄gtā idru) means ‘they were going’.

### The endings are as follows:
