# Locative Case

### The locative case in Kannada shows the location or position of something. It expresses location on, at, or near the declined noun. For example, ರಸ್ತೆಯಲ್ಲಿ (rasteyalli) means ‘on the road’.

### To form the locative case, add -ಅಲ್ಲಿ or -ನಲ್ಲಿ to the end of the noun. However, for the personal pronouns, a different construction is commonly used. The gentive pronoun is used along with the word ಹತ್ತಿರ (hattira), which literally means ‘near’.
